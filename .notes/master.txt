I want a great cli building tool. I have too many problems with playwright, Even
though I accomplished a lot of my goals with it.

Bad
1. Way too namespaced. Everything should be simple. Rake tasks are simple.
2. Too reliant on hanami::cli. I ended up having to monkey patch hanami. I
   should just use ruby's native OptionParser.
3. Dependency issues were very complicated.
4. Shouldn't have bothered making server a hanami app.
5. Turned bundler into a problem instead of using it as a solution


Good
1. Tools weren't bad. os, display, ask were cool.
2. Generator was pretty dope.
3. Worked.

Needs
Ability to accept variable options. (needed for loop-spec)
Simple generator.
Scripts are gems.
Argument & Option parsing.
Subcommand support. (I should investigate how hanami does it).
Simple API wrapping tty tools.
Make everything a module and include in a base class.

Technical Goals
1. Solid testing, including end-to-end tests.
